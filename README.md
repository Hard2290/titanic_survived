# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle Competition
- Kaggle competition link - https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic
- This is binary classification problem.
- The training dataset contains 11 features (Sex, Age, Fare, Name, etc) of 891 passengers, who boarded Titanic ship, along with the target feature "Survived" showing whether they survived (1) or not (0).

## Problem Statement :
- Our goal is to build a model to train on the training dataset and predict whether the passengers survived (1) or not (0) for the test dataset.
- Check the model's performance using "Accuracy" metric.

## Tools used :
- Python - Coding Language
- Pandas - For Data Processing
- Numpy - For Arrays and Computations
- Sklearn - For ML Models and Metrics
- Optuna - For Hyperparameter Tuning
- Matplotlib/Seaborn - For Data Visualization
